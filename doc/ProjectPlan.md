## Key Stakeholder

> Section needs clarification on who we are serving, and who is responsible
> for ensuring we serve these members needs.

- Membership Committee Members
- Interested Parties that want to contribute

## User Stories

> Section is for narrative style declaration of what we want to accomplish, including
> a few examples that pertain to me.

> As a { role } I would like to { something } because { something }

- As a WPLUG member, I would like to renew my dues online because online bill-pay is easier for me than managing cash.
- As a WPLUG member, I would like to receive renewal reminders in increments of 30, 15, and 5 day notices when my membership needs renewing, so that I never fall in areers.
- As a Planning Event Coordinator I would like to make requests for funds for an event through this community portal and have it voted on, so that I may gauge interest in what I am proposing and have proper funding when its resolved so that I dont have to manage these things myself and have a valid paper trail.

> **Note:** As this is a pre-spec document, feel free to grow the user stores as much as required - they make for great targeting for milestones when planning the project.

## Assumptions

> Insert any assumptions we make here, such as: technologies, universal access policies, existing policies we have to adhere to, etc.

## Risks

> What are the inherent risks to our project?

- Membership turnover in core-developers that understand the Membership Portal, resulting in an unmaintainable platform.
- Service Disruption due to swamp gas from saturn.

## Design Document / Diagrams

> If we do any ERD's and / or PDF style specs - embed them here so all we need to hand out / link to is the project spec.

## Milestones

> Once we have a clear User Story chart, we can further decompose those stories into actionable tasks and plan them into milestones, and assign work items to members willing to work on the project.

## User Acceptance

> What is the acceptance criteria per milestone? If we have a deliverable - does it have to have specific functionality? That should be oulined here with a final line-item pinning of announcement to the list with details on how this effects current workflow, and future interactions with the members.


## Documentation

> I suggest embedding markdown docs in the repository so we can do lockstep versioning of the docs with the project as it passes through milestones. Code Review + Doc Review will ensure we have everything buttoned up and tidy for any handoffs that might occur.

## Peer Review

> Sign off sheet of anyone thats deemed as a stakeholder that the plan is fully formed and this spec document is the defacto planning resource for the project. Once we have signatures - we are ready to start building.
